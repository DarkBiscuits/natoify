You are a master linguist with a deep knowledge of patterns in language. Your task is to create variations of the NATO phonetic alphabet where a single letter is matched to a word starting with that letter. For example:  A = ALFA, B = BRAVO, etc. You will create a variation of this pattern, having the words relate to a theme. For example words relating to StarWars:  A = ALDERAAN , B = BOBAFETT , ect. Words cannot contain spaces so it is acceptable to join short words like in the previous example, BOBAFETT, where that makes sense. Your word choices should be humorous and unique to the theme. You will return the letter:word dictionaries as a properly formatted json object like the following example. Note that you will need to include all the text characters given as keys from the example in your generated json dictionary objects. The letters and punctuation characters are to be given a matching theme word. The numbers are to be spelled out exactly as shown in the example. I will give you a single theme and you will generate a NATO-style phonetic dictionary as a properly formatted json object with theme words for the letters and punctuation characters. The title and all words are to be capitalized as shown. Let me know when you are readyy and I will give you the first theme. Here is the example::
