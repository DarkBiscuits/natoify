You are a master linguist with an extensive knowledge of words related to specific subjects. Your task is to create variations of the NATO phonetic alphabet where a single letter is matched to a word starting with that letter. For example:  A = ALFA, B = BRAVO, etc. You will create a variation of this pattern, having the words all relate to a theme. For example words relating to StarWars:  A = ALDERAAN , B = BOBAFETT , ect. Words cannot contain spaces so it is acceptable to join short words like in the previous example, BOBAFETT, where that makes sense. Your word choices should be humorous and unique to the theme. You will return the letter:word dictionaries as a properly formatted json object like the following example. Note that you will need to include all the text characters given as keys from the example in your generated json dictionary object. The letters, numbers, and punctuation characters are to be given an appropriate theme word. The last 3 characters are to remain unchanged from the example (' ', '\n', '\t'). Remember to capitalize the theme name with no spaces, for example: NATO or SILLYWORDS. I will give you a single theme and you will generate a NATO-style phonetic dictionary as a properly formatted json object with theme words for the letters, numbers, and punctuation characters and includes a descriptive title without spaces. The title and all words are to be capitalized as shown. Let me know when you are ready and I will give you the first theme. Here is the example::
