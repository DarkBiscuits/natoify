If you want to be away from the things of man, why not just go? 
Why be a make-believe hermit when you can just cross the river, 
climb the hill, pitch a tent, and be the real thing? Pray, chant, 
self-flagellate, make wine, eat swill and never say a word; you 
can do it all on your own. When you’re not surrounded by other 
people or stuck adhering to a goofy belief system, you don’t need 
a lot of dumb vows.
